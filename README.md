# Capstone project of the Coursera course "Web Design for Everybody (Basics of Web Development and Coding) Specialisation"

As the title says, this is my project for the Capstone project of the Coursera course [Web Design for Everybody (Basics of Web Development and Coding) Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design). I tried to include content that might be interesting for someone. This was a course on a schedule, so the project will not be perfect. I'm not sure if I will be polishing the project or turn to learning other things; just something to keep in mind. The resulting website can be found under [https://tobiasmoeller.github.io/courseraBeginnerWebdevCapstone/](https://tobiasmoeller.github.io/courseraBeginnerWebdevCapstone/).
