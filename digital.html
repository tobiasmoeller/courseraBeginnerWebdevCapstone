      <h2 id="keyboard">The Keyboard</h2>
      <p class="twocol">
        When I started getting pain on the outside of my left wrist, I tried to analyze what was going on. I used a regular full size keyboard. When I positioned my fingers in the home row, I noticed that my hands were angled outward at the wrist. Additionally, I noticed that I was using mostly my left pinky to press shift. In addition to that, I used a lot of keyboard shortcuts that involve the ctrl key which I did exclusively using my left pinky again. All of this meant a lot of outward motion in the left wrist on top of already having my wrist angled outward throughout the day as well as a lot of strain on my left pinky finger.<br>
        I noticed that pressing keys on the keyboard was hurting my wrist more at the end of the day, so I thought of looking into mechanical keyboards to be able to customise the behaviour of the individual keys. Here is the summary of my research.
      </p>
      <h3 id="mk">Mechanical Keyboards</h3>
      <p class="twocol">
        A lot of regular keyboards are so called rubber dome keyboards. This means that there is a membrane at the bottom of your keyboard. When a key is pressed to the bottom it creates a contact that sends a signal to the computer that the key was pressed. This necessitates what is called <em>bottoming out</em>. Bottoming out means that you press the key all the way to the bottom until you reach the hard stop of the keyboard. In contrast, a mechanical keyboard has a <em>mechanical switch</em> under every individual key. On top of each of these switches, the key cap is placed. This has the advantage of being able to have different switches available that behave differently, yielding very different typing experiences.
      </p>
      <h4>Mechanical Keyboard Switches</h4>
      <p class="twocol">
        There are several different styles of switch behaviour that one can choose from. Firstly, you can choose how the <strong>resistance</strong> of the key changes while you are pressing down. In a lot of switches the total key travel possible before you reach the bottom is 4 mm. The key signal is sent to the computer after having pressed the key down 2 mm or more. There are basically two different styles of resistance behaviours available: <em>linear</em> and <em>tactile</em>. Linear means that resistance increases linearly when pressing down. This also means that you don't feel when the key is being actuated, i.e., when the actual key signal is being transferred to the computer. Tactile means that you feel a bump when actuating the key. In other words, resistance increases while pressing the key down before having actuated the key and then sharply drops after the key was actuated. This can potentially make it easier to avoid bottoming out. Bottoming out is a source of noise (which might need to be considered when working in an office with other people), and there are people who say that the abrupt stopping of motion puts strain on your wrist. I don't know whether this is true or not but a tactile switch can potentially make it easier to learn not to bottom out on every key stroke. For both types of switch, there are multiple variants available that differ in the amount of resistance they provide. A lighter switch requires less force to press down, a heavier requires more.<br>
        Secondly, with tactile switches you can choose to have the switch provide <strong>audible feedback</strong> at the actuation point which could potentially further help with reducing the amount of bottoming out keys. On the other hand it increases noise levels. Switches that provide this type of audible feedback are called <em>clicky</em>.<br>
        Which switch is the best for you is entirely up to preference, so trying out keys is a good idea. I tried tactile clicky switches on a keyboard of a friend of mine but it didn't help with the pain in my wrist and the noise was understandably irritating my collegues so I quickly stopped using it. Since I did neither enjoy the tactileness nor the clickyness, I looked at linear non-clicky switches. I ordered a mechanical keyboard with linear switches that provided the least resistance available without having to build the keyboard myself (which is something that a lot of people enjoy). My reasoning was that less resistance when typing would translate to less strain on my fingers and wrist. In this case they were Cherry MX Red switches. Additionally, I put so called O-rings in which are just small rubber rings that are placed on the stem of each individual key cap. They dampen the sound when bottoming out. The keyboard I ordered was also programmable which means that the individual keys can be changed, e.g., have the t where the q would be. This can be used to use different keyboard layouts since the regular QWERTY is not the only choice available. When the pain did not get better with the low resistance keys, I looked into just that.
      </p>
      <h3 id="layout">Alternative Keyboard Layouts</h3>
      <p class="twocol">
        The QWERTY (or QWERTZ in my case) layout is not the only one available. For the English language, there are for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a> or <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>. Since I am German and most of my typing at work is in German, I looked at layouts that are optimised for the German language. I came across <a href="http://www.adnw.de/">"Aus der Neo-Welt"</a> (unfortunately only available in German).<br>
        When you look at the regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_keyboard_layout">German QWERTZ keyboard layout</a> and analyse it for how key strokes are divided by hand and individual fingers, how many are on the home row, and how common letter pairs are typed, you quickly notice that this layout is far from ideal from an ergonomic perspective. The people from "Aus der Neo-Welt" (adnw) optimised the layout by choosing a random layout, evaluating it based on numerous German texts, switching two random letters, and then comparing both layouts. The better one is kept, the worse one is discarded. They did this until no switching of any two letters would result in an improved layout. The evaluation of indivdual layouts was, in short, based on several criteria: the more a letter is used, the better its position needs to be; the fingers should be used in equal measure; consecutive letters should not be written with the same or adjacent fingers. There are different layouts available that introduce other criteria or weigh criteria differently. Since I had pain on the outside of my wrist, I went for a layout that minimises consecutive key strokes with adjacent fingers that are not index and middle finger since these motions were painful to me. This is the layout that I used:
      </p>
      <figure class="text-center">
        <img src="img/kay.png" alt="K.A,Y keyboard layout" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10">
        <figcaption  class="figure-caption text-left">The K.A,Y keyboard layout (image created with <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">keyboard layout editor</a>)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="twocol">
        It was very difficult to change to a new layout. I had to consciously type every letter to avoid muscle memory from setting in and going to the location where the letter I wanted to type used to be. This allowed me to properly learn touch typing, i.e., being able to write without ever needing to look at the keyboard. Once I got up to speed, I noticed that the new layout did help with the pain but some pain still remained. This led me to look into ergonomic keyboards.
      </p>
      <h3 id="ergo">Ergonomics</h3>
      <p class="twocol">
        Since changing key switch behaviour as well as layout was not enough to fully get rid of pain in my left wrist, I looked into ergonomics recommendations for the work space more thoroughly. I read that the wrist should be vertically and horizontally straight while typing. This led me to buy a <strong>wrist rest</strong> to avoid creating an upward angle in my wrist when not typing. It is important to note that <strong>the wrists should only be rested on the wrist rest when not typing</strong>. When you type while resting your wrists on the rest, you likely depress the tissue at the wrist. If you type in this state, the tendons that are involved in moving your fingers to type may rub against the canals they are in. This may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. For me, "floating" over the keyboard while typing is both comfortable and allows me to type faster.<br>
        However, the wrist rest did not lead to my pain residing completely. Therefore, I looked into <strong>ergonomic keyboards</strong>. Most of mass produced keyboards have a slight U-shape to decrease the angle in the wrist. Additionally, they often have a "bump" in the middle to allow the wrists and arms to rotate outward which is supposed to decrease strain on all moving parts involved in typing. This sounded pretty good. Unfortunately, my requirements of the keyboard being mechanical to allow me to use the light linear switches and being programmable to allow for an alternative layout put quite some constraints on my search for a keyboard.
        Additionally, I came across keyboards that did not possess the regular horizontal shift of key rows but had them in a perfect grid or in a column shifted fashion. I did not find clear evidence whether this is better than the regular layout but since I wanted to minimise outward motion with my hands, having for example the letter q directly above the a instead of shifted to the left, seemed to reduce the outward motion.
      </p>
      <h3 id="sol">My Solution</h3>
      <p class="twocol">
        To sum up, I wanted a keyboard that allowed me to decrease the angle on the outside of my wrist, have light linear switches, be programmable to allow for an alternative layout, be compatible with a wrist rest, allow me to increase separation of my hands, and allow for outward rotation of the arms and wrists. What I found was the <strong><a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a></strong>.<br>
        The Ergodox EZ is a mechanical keyboard. This enabled me to use the light linear switches I wanted. It consists of two separate halves which enable me to put the keyboard where my hands naturally fall when I sit at a desk. Additionally, it enables me to have horizontally straight wrists. The wrist rests are made specifically for the keyboard and allow me to have vertically straight wrists when resting my hands on the keyboard. Additionally, they offer a tilt/tent kit which allows adjusting the plane of the keys which allowed me to rotate my arms and wrists outward. It is freely programmable since it uses the very powerful <a href="http://qmk.fm/">QMK Firmware</a> which is open source (which is another plus). This allows using multiple layers (among other great things). This means that you can have letters under your hand and if you hold a certain key, the letters change to a numpad on the right and special characters on the right. There are a lot more awesome features which you can find in the <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/">QMK documentation</a>. And last but not least, it has column shifted key arrangement and a thumb cluster that allows to use thumbs for a lot more than just the space bar which enables me to put strain off my pinky fingers. I use the thumb cluster extensively, especially in the combination with a QMK feature that allows a key to have one function when tapping it (e.g. enter) and another function when holding it (e.g. ctrl). I use this feature to have ctrl, shift, alt, altgr, windows, space, tab, enter, backspace, and delete all on the thumb cluster. No more pinky stretching for shortcuts. Below is my final keyboard layout as well as other images that illustrate the points I made.

To keep it easier to read, I did not include the shifted special characters. They are the usual ones from the German QWERTZ layout. What is written on key cap fronts is the modifier that activates when holding the key instead of tapping.</figcaption>

        Since using this keyboard, the pain has vanished. It is important to notice that a solution like this does not necessarily have to work for you.

      <h2 id="mouse">The Mouse</h2>
      <p class="twocol">
        The new keyboard is rather wide on the desk. This means that having my mouse on the right of the keyboard puts it kind of far off which ment extending my arm and shoulder to move it. Therefore, I looked for an alternative. I came upon mice that utilise a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackball">tracking ball</a>. That just means that instead of moving the mouse you rotate a sphere in a hole to move the cursor. This implies that the mouse itself does not move when moving the cursor.<br>
        There are two main kinds of <strong>trackball mice</strong>: ones that have the ball at the <em>center</em> and ones where you have it at the <em>thumb</em>. I tried a thumb trackball at a friend and liked it. It is now positioned between the two keyboard halves. I have read that having the trackball moved by the thumb is not a good idea because the thumb is isolated when moving the cursor. Since I try to do as much as I can with the keyboard, this has not proven problematic for me yet.
